            The cosplay of Sin becme the bubble under uncertain circumstances and
            the blessed AnimeExpo Con is ground zero which was blessed by the bubble.
            Nothing was left after its rising, only bones, and new nature, trees, greens,

            of all buildings and man-made structures were systematically replaced with
            natural objects almost instantaneously.
